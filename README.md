# ReactNFTCard!
This project is an NFT preview card that renders cards on different NFTs. In the contains some informations also, such as Date of sale,price,days left,etc.

# Focus of the Project
This project helped me practice the use of mapping of arrays in React and how to extract informations from the object and use them on the UI of the card.
